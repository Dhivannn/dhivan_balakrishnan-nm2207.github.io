                <p> Singapore Changi Airport is main airport in Singapore and is 
                    acclaimed as one of the best airports in the world, known for its
                    state of the art facilities. Beyond just the 
                    beautiful amentities, the airport is the 9th busiest airport in the 
                    world in 2023, according to the Airport Council International, reigning as a  major 
                    transportation hub in the Asia-Pacific region.
                <br>
                <br>
                    As seen from the graph below, it saw a steady increase in passenger numbers, reaching a record high 
                    in 2019, managing over 68.3 million
                    passengers. Changi Airport hosted over 80 international carriers and flew 
                    to over a 100 countries worldwide.

                However, during COVID-19, Singapore Changi Airport along with the rest of the world came to 
                a standstill. As COVID-19 cases continued to rise, countries fearing the spread of the virus 
                started to close thier borders to international passengers. However, border restrictions deferred 
                country to country. Some countries like China, saw an immediate full-closure of its borders, whereas in 
                the United States and the United Kingdom, the border restrictions were less restrictive and simply required
                travellers to take a PCR-test prior to their departure/arrival and quarantine when necessary.

            <p>This graph represents the travel restrictions in Singapore's top travel
                desitnations. This value is the average restriction score from 2020 to 2022, and for reference
                Singapore's average was 2.052. Major markets that had more enforcive policies such as Australia and China thus saw less flights 
                to and from Singapore. Such travel restrictions severly hindered travel from the start 
                of the virus in 2020 till the end of 2022 when countries slowly started to move towards an endemic.
            <br>
            <br>
                As a result, Changi Airport was hit severly due to the reduction in the number of passengers travelling 
                to and through Singapore. Even Singapore's national carrier Singapore Airlines saw a drastic drop in profits
                having to lay off many staff in the process.

                At the start of 2022, countries started to move towards an endemic and started re-opening their borders to 
                international travellers. This saw the first wave of eager travelers grasping the opportunity to travel once
                again. As of March 2023, Singapore Changi Airport has reached 80% of pre-COVID capacity, and it has continued 
                to show its ability to bounce back despite the hurdles it faced during the pandemic.

                Above is the list of the top 5 busiest international routes in the world as of 2023, in relation to the number of 
                seats that are offered on each route. Singapore dominates this list, claiming 2 busiest routes : From Kuala Lumpur 
                to Singapore and Jakarta to Singapore. This is testament to its image as a international hub, as it continues to 
                welcome pre-covid levels of travel through collaborations with the Singapore Tourism Board as well as maintaing its
                image as a world-class travel hub.

                        Even if Singapore continues it's efforts to reach pre-COVID levels, would it truly be the same as before? 
                        The departures in 2022 was only approximately 56% of pre-covid capacity (Left Graph) which highlights how there is actually 
                        a significant decrease in flights offered. This decrease in supply of flights due to the slow return of airline operations coupled 
                        with the significant increase in demand for air travel would adversly affect ticket prices, pushing the prices higher than it was
                        pre-COVID. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        However, as airlines continue to increase thier presence in Singapore and start to offer more seats to other travel destinations, 
                        we can expect prices to slowly ease back to pre-COVID levels. The top right graph displays this in action, from the start of the year 
                        where there were limited flights to Shanghai in China resulting in the rather high one-way flight prices. However, as Singapore 
                        Airlines and Scoot continued to increase their presence in the China market and restart flights as China started opening up, we can see 
                        flight prices slowly start to decrease.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Changi Airport has also welcomed new carriers such as Bamboo Air, Tway and Starway which has offered travellers with new ways to 
                        connect to thier travel desitnations.

              In Summary, Singapore Changi Airport is on the right track to recovery post-COVID-19. While recovery might
              be slow, stagnant and might not exactly be how it was pre-COVID, Changi airport has shown that 
              it is capable to bounce back and provide travellers with an uncomparable travel experience. 
              <br>
              <br>
              With its continued drive to push boundaries and engage in disruptive innovation, I believe Changi Airport 
              would be able to take on such future challengers steadfast.
